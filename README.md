I created a random number generator that rounds down to the nearest whole number.
I assigned up to 3 integers to the aphabets 26 letters.
The page will only last for 15 seconds until refresh.

I included steps for installing a viable server and its packages for transmitting encryption keys.
when you click the "Generate Random Alphabet" button, it will trigger the server to generate a result, save it to a file (result.json), and then send the result back to the client to display.
